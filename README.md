# WTF is Node.js
## A guide for .Net and Java developers

As Node.js takes the developer and Startup community by force, those of us that have not used it find ourselves in a position where we must choose to either adapt and learn, or be left behind. This presentation serves as a foundation to learning what Node.js is, how it works, and what it is mainly used for. This talk assumes that the audience is already familiar with other programming languages and concepts.

We will focus on how the Node.js runtime works with its event loop, what the ecosystem looks like, and the big advantages to using Node.js over other languages and runtimes.
